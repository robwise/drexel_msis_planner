# Drexel MSIS Planner
This is my first Ruby on Rails project. I am attempting to learn more about Rails development and heard from many places that it's important to get your hands dirty early on and just start coding. I've already learned a lot doing it this way.

The point of the project is to develop a website that allows MSIS students at Drexel University's College of Computing and Informatics (CCI) to plan the courses they want to take in order to complete their degree. Drexel has a very complex ruleset for prerequisite and corequisite courses and does not offer courses every quarter. Therefore, without the aid of a tool such as this, it can be difficult to plan one's degree ahead of time.

## Feature List
The website shall:
- Allow users to register and manage their accounts
- Allow users to view available courses
- Allow users to enter the courses they have already taken
- Allow users to see the status of their degree (% complete, GPA, number of course credits in each degree requirement category)
- Allow users to create course plans
- Allow users to add planned courses to course plans
- Validate that the plan does not violate any course prerequisite or corequisite requirements

Future features:
- Scrape course offering data from the Drexel Term Master Schedule
- Display when each course was historically offered (by quarter and year)
- Validate that the plan does not include any courses that are planned for quarters in which they are unlikely to be offered based on historical data

## Getting Started
